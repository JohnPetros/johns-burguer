        The John&apos;s Burger Sandwich Shop opened in early August 2012, and
        its first store was located on Roberto Freire Avenue in Capim Macio.
      </p>
      <p class='leading-6'>
        The brand started in October 2011 with a discreet sandwich cart, also on
        Roberto Freire Avenue, next to √Åguia Piscinas. The sandwich shop had a
        limited menu, standing out for offering sandwiches made with artisanal
        burgers.

      <p class='leading-6'>
        Within five months of the cart&apos;s operation, the number of customers
        doubled, and the space became too small to meet the demand. It was then
        necessary to invest in the construction of a larger and more comfortable
        location. It took five months of work on the new space, which is now one
        of the busiest spots in the neighborhood.
